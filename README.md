# Faster Block Placement
This mod is likeÂ [Accurate Block Placement Reborn](https://modrinth.com/mod/accurate-block-placement-reborn/) but for Forge. It removes the 4-tick delay induced by vanilla Minecraft. For example, if you're moving fast and trying to place a line of blocks, you will miss some blocks and create gaps in your line. With this mod enabled, those gaps will mostly be gone.

## WARNING
as this mod, especially on public servers with anti-cheats, can lead to you being banned using this mod.
